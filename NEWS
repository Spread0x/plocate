plocate 1.0.6, October 30th, 2020

  - Escape unprintable characters, quotes, newlines and the likes
    when outputting file names to a terminal, similar to GNU ls.
    This is to reduce the security impact of malicious filenames
    (e.g. containing color or more nefarious escape codes).
    It is not active when using -0, or when piping to another program.

  - Support building databases from plaintext files (plocate-build -p).

  - Portability fixes.


plocate 1.0.5, October 17th, 2020

  - Implement the -b/--basename option.

  - Various bugfixes.


plocate 1.0.4, October 16th, 2020

  - Fix a bug where plocate.db would be evicted from the OS cache
    (the behavior was only meant for benchmarking).

  - On fallback linear scans, such as regexes or very short patterns,
    use multithreading to speed up the search.


plocate 1.0.3, October 15th, 2020

  - Portability fixes; plocate will now compile and run on non-x86
    architectures (although without SIMD optimizations). Note that
    plocate.db is not portable across endians, but this shouldn't
    be a big problem in practice.

  - Filenames are now compressed using a shared zstd dictionary,
    which makes plocate.db ~7% smaller, and linear scans ~20% faster.
    This makes plocate-build ~20% slower, though, since it needs to
    scan through mlocate.db in a special pre-pass to sample filenames
    for the dictionary.

    This changes the dictionary format (from version 0 to version 1),
    but the new plocate can still read version 0 dictionaries,
    so the transition should be seamless.

  - Various bugfixes.


plocate 1.0.2, October 12th, 2020

  - Various bugfixes.


plocate 1.0.1, October 11th, 2020

  - Unbreak linear scanning (for very short patterns, or regexes).


plocate 1.0.0, October 11th, 2020

  - Initial release.
