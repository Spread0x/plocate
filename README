plocate is a locate based on posting lists, consuming mlocate's database
ahead-of-time and making a much faster (and smaller) index out of it.
It supports most mlocate options; see --help or the man page (man -l plocate.1)
for more information.

plocate is in beta. The file format is stable, but may still change
(if so, plocate will notify you itself that you need to rerun
plocate-build). To build and install, you will need a C++17 compiler
and a development package for Zstd (https://facebook.github.io/zstd/).
liburing (https://github.com/axboe/liburing) and a kernel supporting
io_uring (Linux 5.1 or newer) is optional, but strongly recommended
for best performance, especially if you do not have an SSD. Installation
is run as:

  meson obj
  cd obj
  ninja
  sudo ninja install

To build the database for the first time after install, you can do

  sudo /etc/cron.daily/plocate

or equivalently, run the update-plocate.sh script from the source
directory as root (it is the same file installed to /etc/cron.d).

If you wish to run some tests of the TurboPFor implementation against
the reference implementation, you can check it out and run as follows:

  git clone https://github.com/powturbo/TurboPFor-Integer-Compression
  ( cd TurboPFor-Integer-Compression && make -j8 )
  cd obj
  ninja reconfigure
  ninja bench
